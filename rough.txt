Hello

Since I don't like depending on odd third party things for this behavior (even though process.browser seems to come from Webpack), I think the preferred way to check is for presence of appContext.ctx.req like this:

async getInitialProps (appContext) {

    if (appContext.ctx.req) // server? 
    {
        //server stuff
    }
    else {
        // client stuff
    }
}
